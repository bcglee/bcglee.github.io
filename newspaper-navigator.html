        This page contains a number of resources for Newspaper Navigator, the
        project that I am carrying out while an Innovator-in-Residence at the
        Library of Congress. The goal of Newspaper Navigator is to re-imagine
        searching over the visual content in
        <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov" target="_blank"
          >Chronicling America</a
        >. The project consists of two steps:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Extracting the headlines, photographs, illustrations, comics,
            cartoons, and advertisements from the 16.3 million pages in
            <i>Chronicling America</i>.
            <b
              >This step is complete, and the Newspaper Navigator dataset has
              been released!</b
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Re-imagining exploratory search over this extracted visual content.
          </li>
        </ul>

        All deliverables resulting from the Newspaper Navigator project
        (including code, data, etc.), is placed into
        <b>the public domain</b> for unrestricted re-use. An enormous thank you
        to <a href="https://labs.loc.gov/" target="_blank">LC Labs</a>,

        This is the landing page for the Newspaper Navigator dataset. Here, you
        will find details about how to query the data over https and S3. There
        are also hundreds of pre-packaged datasets for immediate use - no coding
        necessary!

        This paper details the construction of the Newspaper Navigator dataset.
        This includes details on training the visual content recognition model,
        statistics on running the pipeline, and visualizations of the dataset
        itself.

        This GitHub repo contains all of the code for the Newspaper Navigator
        Project, as well as the finetuned visual content recognition model
        weights, the dataset used for finetuning (annotations from the Beyond
        words project augmented with additional annotations), and demos. The
        entire contents of the repo are placed into the public domain.
