        This page contains a number of resources for Newspaper Navigator, my
        <a href="https://labs.loc.gov/about/opportunities/innovator-in-residence-program">
        Innovator in Residence</a> project at the
        Library of Congress. The goal of Newspaper Navigator is to re-imagine
        searching over the visual content in
        <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov" target="_blank"
          >Chronicling America</a
        >. The project consists of two steps:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Extracting the headlines, photographs, illustrations, comics,
            cartoons, and advertisements from the 16.3 million pages in
            <i>Chronicling America</i>.
            <b
              >This step is complete, and the Newspaper Navigator dataset has
              been released!</b
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Re-imagining exploratory search over this extracted visual content.
            <b> The Newspaper Navigator search app has been released! You can find it

            </b>
          </li>
        </ul>
        With Newspaper Navigator, I hope to engage the American public with the Library of
        Congress's incredible collections, as well advance research in computer science,
        digital libraries, and the digital humanities.
        All deliverables resulting from the Newspaper Navigator project

        statistics on running the pipeline, and visualizations of the dataset
        itself. <b>*This paper was named Best Resource Paper Runner-up at

        In this paper, which I call a "data archaeology," I consider the digitization journeys of
        four different pages in Black newspapers in Chronicling America that reproduce the same photograph
        of W.E.B. Du Bois. In doing so, I unpack how each step in the pipelines, such as the imaging process and the
        construction of training data, not only imprints bias on the resulting Newspaper Navigator dataset
        but also propagates the bias via the machine learning algorithms employed. I investigate the limitations machine
        learning as it relates to cultural heritage, from marginalization and erasure via algorithmic bias to
        unfair labor practices in the construction of commonly-used datasets. I argue that any use must be done with an understanding
        of the broader socio-technical ecosystems in which the algorithms have been utilized. *This paper is forthcoming in Issue 15.4 of
        <i>Digital Humanities Quarterly</i>.

      The Newspaper Navigator search application enables visitors to search over 1.5 million
      Newspaper Navigator photos. In addition to providing faceted + keyword search affordances,
      The application empowers visitors to train their own AI navigators to search 1.5 million Newspaper
      Navigator photos by visual similarity. Visitors can train AI navigators by labeling positive and
      negative training examples and tune the system on the fly, as training and predicting on all 1.5
      million photos takes just a couple of seconds. The AI navigators are powered by ResNet-18 image
      embeddings.

          Newspaper Navigator and the Visual Layouts of Ethnic Periodicals
        </h2>
        <text>
          With periodicals scholars Jim Casey, Sarah Salter, and Joshua Ortiz Baco, I am studying the evolution of visual layouts of ethnic periodicals
          within <i>Chronicling America</i>. Using the Newspaper  Navigator dataset, it is possible to directly quantify the similarity of layouts across millions of newspaper pages, enablingus not only to trace the technological developments of printing presses but also to uncover the hidden editorial practices embedded within layouts themselves.  For example, we have identified clusters of newspaper titles withsimilar visual layouts, such as networks of African-American titles that feature illustrations and photographsof members of their communities in portrait poses in the center of their front pages.  The editors’ choice of ashared visual grammar speaks to the ways in which visual culture featured prominently into editorial practices. Our first paper detailing this collaboration has been accepted at the <i>Computational Humanities Research</i> (CHR) 2021. You can find more details below:
