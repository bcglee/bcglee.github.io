    <h1>Newspaper Navigator</h1>
    <h3>Benjamin Charles Germain Lee</h3>

    <div>
      <text>
        This page contains a number of resources for Newspaper Navigator, my
        <a href="https://labs.loc.gov/about/opportunities/innovator-in-residence-program">
        Innovator-in-Residence</a> project at the
        Library of Congress. The goal of Newspaper Navigator is to re-imagine
        searching over the visual content in
        <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov" target="_blank"
          >Chronicling America</a
        >. The project consists of two steps:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Extracting the headlines, photographs, illustrations, comics,
            cartoons, and advertisements from the 16.3 million pages in
            <i>Chronicling America</i>.
            <b
              >This step is complete, and the Newspaper Navigator dataset has
              been released!</b
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Re-imagining exploratory search over this extracted visual content.
            <b> The Newspaper Navigator search app will be launched in mid-September!
            </b>
          </li>
        </ul>

        All deliverables resulting from the Newspaper Navigator project
        (including all code, the dataset, etc.), are placed into
        <b>the public domain</b> for unrestricted re-use. An enormous thank you

        This is the landing page for the Newspaper Navigator dataset. Here, you
        will find details about how to query the data over https and S3. There
        are also hundreds of pre-packaged datasets for immediate use - no coding
        necessary!

        This paper details the construction of the Newspaper Navigator dataset.
        This includes details on training the visual content recognition model,
        statistics on running the pipeline, and visualizations of the dataset
        itself. This paper will be presented at
        <a href="https://www.cikm2020.org/" target="_blank">CIKM 2020</a> in October.

        <b>Data Archaeology:</b>
        <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.17613/k9gt-6685" target="_blank"

        <br />
        In this paper, which I call a "data archaeology," I consider the digitization journeys of
        four different pages in Black newspapers in Chronicling America that reproduce the same photograph
        of W.E.B. Du Bois. In doing so, I unpack how each step in the pipelines, such as the imaging process and the
        construction of training data, not only imprints bias on the resulting Newspaper Navigator dataset
        but also propagates the bias via the machine learning algorithms employed. I investigate the limitations machine
        learning as it relates to cultural heritage, from marginalization and erasure via algorithmic bias to
        unfair labor practices in the construction of commonly-used datasets. I argue that any use must be done with an understanding
        of the broader socio-technical ecosystems in which the algorithms have been utilized.

        This GitHub repo contains all of the code for the Newspaper Navigator
        Project, as well as the finetuned visual content recognition model
        weights, the dataset used for finetuning (annotations from the Beyond
        words project augmented with additional annotations), and demos. The
        entire contents of the repo are placed into the public domain.

        <u>The Newspaper Navigator Search Application</u>
      </h2>
      <text>
      <b>Website:</b>
      <i>launching in mid-September!</i>
      <br />
      The Newspaper Navigator search application enables visitors to search over 1.5 million
      Newspaper Navigator photos. In addition to providing faceted + keyword search affordances,
      The application empowers visitors to train their own AI navigators to search 1.5 million Newspaper
      Navigator photos by visual similarity. Visitors can train AI navigators by labeling positive and
      negative training examples and tune the system on the fly, as training and predicting on all 1.5
      million photos takes just a couple of seconds. The AI navigators are powered by ResNet-18 image
      embeddings.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Demo:</b> <i>to appear at <a href="https://uist.acm.org/uist2020/">
        UIST 2020 in October</i></a>
      <br />
      This demo will present <i>open faceted search</i>, the new mode of search launched in the
      Newspaper Navigator Search Application. From the computer science perspective, open faceted
      search empowers users to define their own facets in an open-domain fashion. The demo paper
      and video will be added here in the coming weeks!
